#  Contributing to modelestimator

This software was written to enable some phylogenetic studies I want to do, but it might be useful
for others studying evolution.

Maybe you have an idea of how to improve `modelestimator`? There are several ways to contribute, for
example:

* Bug reports
* Feature requests
* Better examples
* Better documentation (which is very limited as of this writing)
* Code contributions

## The aim of modelestimator

`modelestimator` is intended to be n easy-to-use tool that is easy to use in a command-line
environment. Contributions should be made with this aim in mind.

## Bug reports and feature requests

Please consider creating an issue in the `modelestimator-v2` repo if you have a bug report or
feature request. Emails are welcome too, but are harder to keep track of in relation to
`modelestimator` development. GitHub has a guide called [Mastering
Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to get you started.

A bug report becomes easier to understand and address if it is accompanied with:

* A clear and detailed description of the problem.
* An example invocation.
* Sample data.

## Code and text contributions

Any code or text contribution is welcome!

* Pull requests are preferred. The recommended workflow is to
    - fork this repo on github.com,
	- work in your own copy,
	- create a pull request to the original alv repo.
  See GitHub's guide [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
* Please try to add a unit test for a contributed feature or fixed bug.
* For large changes, please discuss with @arvestad first. Or just fork, rename, and continue! This
